# Deployment Note: Hosting a Unity WebGL Build on GitHub Pages (Build-Only Repo)

## What this is
This repository hosts a **Unity WebGL build output** as a static site using **GitHub Pages**. The Unity source project is not included (only the exported build artifacts are available).

## Repo structure (what to expect)
At the repository root you’ll find:
- `index.html` (the entry page)
- `Build/` (build artifacts generated by Unity)
- `TemplateData/` (template assets used by the WebGL page)

## How it’s hosted
GitHub Pages serves the repo as a static website. The playable demo is available here:
https://zimzamyoyoman.github.io/TheRickAndMortyPlatformer/

## Basic troubleshooting (build-only)
If a WebGL build fails to load on GitHub Pages, the first thing to check is whether any required files are missing or moved.

Quick checks:
- Confirm `index.html`, `Build/`, and `TemplateData/` remain in the same structure as exported
- Open browser DevTools → **Network** and look for **404 (Not Found)** requests
- If assets 404, restore folder names/paths to match what `index.html` references

## Notes / limitations
Because the Unity source project is not included, this repo is meant as:
- a **playable demo**, and
- a lightweight reference for the file structure required to host a Unity WebGL export on a static host.
