# The Rick and Morty Platformer!

It’s the Rick and Morty Platformer! It’s like Mario, but instead of Mario and turtles, it’s Morty and Rick! How genius is that! You play as Morty, and you collect crystals while avoiding different hazards and obstacles, and use a multitude of powerups to your advantage.

## LEVELS
1.	Each level has multiple portals, and the player must choose one of them (each may take the player to a different level, or maybe to a level that the player has already been through) 
2.	Level with red and blue portals, like the pills in Matrix, if you chose the red one, the game continues, if you chose the blue one, you enter a previous level or something meta that represents the actual reality of the player (maybe the screen turns black so that the player can see his reflection)
3.	Levels consist of ladders, elevators(?), teleportation platformers, and more.

## IDEAS FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS
1.	A level with reverse gravity or some kind of gravity hijinks
2.	A level with extreme camera shaking (the level breaks apart or something falls from the sky
3.	A level where the level breaks down bit by bit and then the player is left in a void (you have to try and find your way out of the void)
4.	A level in which you fall recurrently, a huge portal is present at the bottom which takes you back to the top of the level. In the middle are several platforms which players must try and get to, one of which contains the actual portal to the next level.

## POWERUPS/PICKUPS
1.	Guns
2.	Grenades?
3.	Seeds which increase the number of lives (https://pocketmortys.net/items/level-up-mega-seed)
4.	Crystals 
5.	Powerup that turns everything into slow motion (to avoid lots of gunfire and obstacles, using time. timescale)

#IDEAS FOR DIFFERENT ENEMIES
1.	Enemies which move left and right in a certain area
2.	Enemies that chase the player 
3.	Mr. Meeseeks as the enemy, the longer he lives, the more aggressive he gets (How? Maybe he multiplies so that he can kill the player faster), dies when he kills you (All the Meeseeks that are spawned from one should be that one’s child, so that all of them die whenever the player is killed)

## BACKLOG
1.	Enemy death blood particle effects and improved deathSFX (playtest pending)
2.	See the video: Why your platformer sucks and implement the changes in that video in your game
3.	Pause menu on pressing escape (should have buttons to go to menu, restart the game, and quit the game) 
4.	Main menu options screen to increase/decrease difficulty and volume 
5.	Main menu information screen about various enemies and gases and powerups/pickups 
6.	Player.prefs to save high-score (or the most suitable option)
7.	Canvas Scaling
8.	Add improved joystick, jump, and gun buttons for mobile
9.	Android build 
10.	Footsteps sound effect?
11.	Trigger waypoints to attack player with weapons from different sides (transform. Translate, similar to the water in vertical scroller), or maybe to spawn chaser enemies
12.	Change Enemy Idle to Enemy (playtest pending)
13.	Decrease size of player’s feet collider to prevent accidental killing of enemy on jumping (playtest pending)
14.	Turn player green on coming in contact with poisonous gas to give feedback that player speed has been temporarily decreased (playtest pending)
15.	Play a sound effect on jumping, impact sounds on falling from a height?
16.	Increase rate of water in Level 3 (playtest pending)
17.	Gun projectile and motion
18.	Add array of jumping sounds

## GASES
1.	Floating Gas 
2.	Gas that slows you down (perhaps change this)
3.	Gas that increases your speed? (Add trail renderer effect if implemented: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TcEfIXpmRI)
4.	Death Gas
